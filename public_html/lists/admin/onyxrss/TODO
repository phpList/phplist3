
1.) Support element attributes.  I know HOW to do it, I just
    cannot think of a logical way to store them in an array.
    PLEASE let me know if you have an good ideas on this.

2.) Make a general set function for variables that can replace
    the four set functions.  This function should take an array
    or the variables separately.

3.) Feed validation option prior to parsing.
