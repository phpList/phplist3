When he had finished, Parmenides expressed their feelings in the following words:--  Socrates, he said, I admire the bent of your mind towards philosophy; tell me now, was this your own distinction between ideas in themselves and the things which partake of them? and do you think that there is an idea of likeness apart from the likeness which we possess, and of the one and many, and of the other things which Zeno mentioned?  I think that there are such ideas, said Socrates.  Parmenides proceeded:  And would you also make absolute ideas of the just and the beautiful and the good, and of all that class?  Yes, he said, I should.  And would you make an idea of man apart from us and from all other human creatures, or of fire and water?  I am often undecided, Parmenides, as to whether I ought to include them or not.  "
